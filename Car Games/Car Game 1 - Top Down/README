This was one of the first games I made. 
Combining my love for video games and cars.
I plan to add obbsticles consisting of cars, busses, byclists, and possibly more.
I will have them going each direction of the road, facing the corresponding way.
I also will add a main menu, including a play button, settings, customization, and an exit button.
I will also add a "You Crashed!" text instead of closing the application; including a "Try Again" button and "Menu" button.
I also want to include music and possibly sound effects and tinker with these.
I am doing all of this in PyGame.
