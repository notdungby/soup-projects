Hi my name is Campbell.
I'm an aspiring programmer and wanted to create a github repository to start storing my projects!
I've always wanted to be a programmer ever since I was 8 when I first exposed to the world of programming.
In this repository I am uploading and improving old projects.
As well as starting new projects!
